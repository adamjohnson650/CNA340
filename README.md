# Boolean Expressions in Python
I'm going to show how boolean expressions work in python. I'm going to have the user enter three random numbers. I set perameters that answer true if the number matches the parameters or false if it does not.This is a quick example how boolean expressions answer True or False.


## Getting Started

These instructions will run this code on your local machine for demonstrating how boolean expressions work in Python.

### Prerequisites

Boolean Expressions in Python requires Python 3 to run. The command below will install Python

Python 3: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.3/python-3.11.3-amd64.exe

```
```

## Running
Once installed you can run the program with the following command

```
"C:\Users\ajjoh\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\Boolean Expression.py"
```
