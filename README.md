# Boolean Expressions in Python
I'm going to show how boolean expressions work in python. I'm going to have the user enter three random numbers. I set perameters that answer true if the number matches the parameters or false if it does not.This is a quick example how boolean expressions answer True or False.


## Getting Started

These instructions will run this code on your local machine for demonstrating how boolean expressions work in Python.

```

Add any additional ways to run the program below
